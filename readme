Crunchbase Lead Generator
Overview
Crunchbase Lead Generator is a Python-based tool that extracts company data from Crunchbase, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uses machine learning to predict potential investment leads. If web scraping fails, the tool automatically generates sample data to ensure functionality.

Features
Web Scraping: Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract company data from Crunchbase.
Fallback Mechanism: If scraping fails, sample data is generated.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes industry trends, funding distributions, and company insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Machine Learning Model: Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict companies likely to raise funds.
Lead Prediction: Identifies high-potential investment leads based on the trained model.

Main Steps
Scrape Crunchbase Data: Attempts to fetch company data from Crunchbase.
Generate Sample Data (if needed): If scraping fails, synthetic data is created.
Perform EDA: Generates visualizations for key insights.
Train Model: Trains a machine learning model to predict potential investment leads.
Identify Potential Leads: Lists companies likely to raise funds.
